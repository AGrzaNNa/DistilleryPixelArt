Distillery is a tool that uses artificial intelligence (AI) through the chat command, such as /serve, to generate images. One of the main advanatges of Distillery is low-threshold entry, because of that it appeals to a wide audience, requiring only imagination and a well-chosen set of words to create images based on personal preferences. Moreover, Distillery offers the possibility of using specialised tags to increase the accuracy and efficiency of the generated images. That are avaible under this link:

The tool is available in both paid and free versions, but free one  has a limit of only 10 generations per day. This can be a bit restrictive, as the AI doesn't always produce exactly what we want. In addition, a trial generation can be lost due to occasional errors in reading the parameters. 

Another drawback is the lack of a personal clipboard, unlike its paid counterpart, Distillery Midjourney. Instead of having a dedicated repository for generations, everything is displayed in the chat. This can be confusing, especially with a large number of generations and frequent corrections, making it difficult to find one's project amidst other people's spam. However, the administration is praiseworthy and offers a great deal of help and active involvement, giving a sense of support and guidance during the image generation process.Despite these drawbacks, the overall process of generating an image remains smooth and fast.

The primary goal is to use Distillery's intelligence to create pixel art characters and environments for the gaming industry, as the title suggests. Distillery proves invaluable in saving the time-consuming nature of pixel art creation that is the most important part of the product. It enables easy creation of multiple looks for character locations and animations, streamlining 2D pixel art production and addressing the challenges posed by the time-consuming nature of pixel art.
