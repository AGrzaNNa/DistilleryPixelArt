The primary goal is to use Distillery's intelligence to create pixel art characters and environments for the gaming industry

Why Distillery ? You may ask.

Basically Distillery is a tool that uses artificial intelligence (AI) through the chat command, such as /serve, to generate images. 
One of the main advanatges of Distillery is low-threshold entry, because of that it appeals to a wide audience, 
requiring only imagination and a well-chosen set of words to create images based on personal preferences. 
Moreover, Distillery offers the possibility of using specialised tags to increase the accuracy and efficiency of the generated images. 

That are avaible under this link:

The tool is available in both paid and free versions, but the free one  has a limit of only 10 generations per day. 
This can be a bit restrictive, as the AI doesn't always produce exactly what we want. 
In addition, a trial generation can be lost due to occasional errors in reading the parameters. 

Another drawback is the lack of a personal clipboard. Unlike its paid counterpart, Distillery MidJourney,
instead of having a dedicated repository for generations, everything is displayed in the chat. 
This can be confusing, especially with a large number of generations and frequent corrections, 
making it difficult to find one's project amidst other people's spam. 
However, the administration is praiseworthy and offers a great deal of help and active involvement, 
giving a sense of support and guidance during the image generation process.
Despite these drawbacks, the overall process of generating an image remains smooth and fast,
and it comes to payment, unlike MidJourney, which only offers a paid version, 
Distillery provides a free option without considering the upper limits it has.
So, if you're looking for a generator with numerous useful commands and excellent support, 
Distillery is the right choice.

#Usage of Distillery when it comes to Game_Dev 

The primary goal is to use Distillery's intelligence to create pixel art characters and environments for the gaming industry,as the title suggests. 
Distillery proves invaluable in saving the time-consuming nature of pixel art creation that is the most important part of the product. 
It enables easy creation of multiple looks for character locations and animations, 
streamlining 2D pixel art production and addressing the challenges posed by the time-consuming nature of pixel art.

Theres two ways of doin it
First one is to generate direcly in Distillery images of 2D models using pixelart style for mentiones game dev. 
Second one is to generate characters using only tags for fantasy rougelike comments and throw it into "Pixel It".

The "Pixel It" is website that allows you to take an image and convert into pixel art. 
You can define the "pixel" size, create a pixel image using a color palette and also convert to a pixel grayscale image. 


Step #1

Open Distillery free-generation pagre and for the example type under command:

/Serve (Free): generate pixelart warrior beard winter clothes in platearmor, be accurate simple shapes 2D 
or
/Serve : : generate pixelart warrior beard winter clothes in platearmor, be accurate simple shapes 2D 
for the premium users

in a while it gonna generate images for my resoult it was this:
